# Reference Implementation of Static Site using NPM Scripts
Reference implementation for HTML Prototypes using NPM Scripts. This codebase is maintained by students and volunteers of [techatpark](http://www.techatpark.com)

### Design Goals

We have below design goals.

1. Use Low level tools as much as possible
1. Stablilty over cutting edge
1. Best Practices and Conventions
1. Build time Speed 

We carefuly avoided using image optimization during build time as it is good to do images at design time rather than build time.
